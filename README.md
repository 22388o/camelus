# camelus

## What is it?

camelus is a nostr client written in flutter, it is in heavy development, feel free to test it but expect some issues and missing features.

## how can I test it?

### Android

You can download the apk from [here](https://camelus.app/), it is signed with my key so you will need to enable "install from unknown sources" in your phone settings.

Otherwise wait for the testlink to be available.

### iOS

I don't have an iOS device so I can't test it, if you have an iOS device and want to test it, you can build it yourself, I will be happy to help you.

Otherwise wait for testflight to be available.
